# Generative Adventure Game

Introducing "The Adventure Game", a concept for the November 2024 "AWS Game Builder Challenge".  It's a text based, open ended, RPG (role playing game).  The game use generative models from Amazon Bedrock using the Converse API to build an AI agent that uses a graph data structure to maintain game state.
