# Amazon Bedrock Adventure Game

Introducing "The Adventure Game", a concept for the November 2024 "AWS Game Builder Challenge".  It's a text based, open ended, RPG (role playing game).  The game use generative models from Amazon Bedrock using the Converse API to build an AI agent that uses a graph data structure to maintain game state.

For a more detailed overview of the project, including how to customize and update the game,please see this blog post: [Building an Open-Ended Text-Based RPG with Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/building-an-open-ended-text-based-rpg-with-amazon-bedrock/)

### Note on Cost:

> Running this project will incur costs that are NOT covered by AWS Free Tier (and may not be covered by AWS credits).  This project makes use of generative models through Amazon Bedrock, and depending on which model is used, the size of prompts and the number of turns, the cost will vary.  This project is not intended to be a cost effective way to run a game.  Please review the [Amazon Bedrock Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/pricing/) page for more details.
